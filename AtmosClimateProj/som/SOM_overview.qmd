### SOM Background

There's lots of good tutorials and examples out there. See https://pjbartlein.github.io/REarthSysSci/netCDF.html or https://civil.colorado.edu/\\\~balajir/CVEN6833/HWs/Student-Solution-HW2/J-Garland-hw2-html/HW2_Q9.html

### Creating the SOM grid

There's a lot of info about SOM grid size. For example, this suggests an ideal grid size of \~ 5\*sqrt(N) , where N is the number of rows of the SST object.

Results are sensitive to the grid size -- so ideally we would do a sensitivity across a range of values.
